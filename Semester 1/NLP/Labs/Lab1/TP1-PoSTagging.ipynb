    "## Part-of-Speech tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "This part was produced using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org).  \n",
    "If you are used to it, you can [download the corresponding notebook code from here](TP1-PoSTagging.ipynb). If not, no problem at all, this is not mandatory at all: simply proceed as usual in your favorite Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try NLTK with a simple example. The application here considered consist in associating \"_syntactic tags_\" (called \"_Part-of-Speech tags_\") to the words in a text; i.e. to determine the grammatical role of each word in the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications of PoS tagging are numerous. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* help for \"lemmatization\" (obtain the words’ canonical forms);\n",
    "* disambiguate words for higher level treatments (e.g. information extraction);\n",
    "* provide syntactic clues (\"roles\") for unknown words (\"guessers\"), ...\n",
    "\n",
    "PoS taggers usually reach a 95-99% performance level, depending on the language considered, the application and the granularity of the tag-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "More about Part-of-Speech tagging will be presented during the semester (Week 5). The purpose of the present exercise is simply to illustrate this NLP task and to check NLTK installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tag a sentence in NLTK from the python interpreter, you first need to download required models, if not done yet:"

    "**Note 1:** A parser can be used instead of a corpus-based POS-tagger to disambiguate words in context. But this demands more work on resource development (writing grammars), which is costly; and, the processing is also more costly: context-free parsing takes cubic time (w.r.t. sentence length) as opposed to PoS-tagging which takes linear time.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** Systematically disambiguating at each level of language (lexical, syntactic, semantic) is most of the time not necessary at all. It is often better to leave the disambiguation to a later, more informed, processing level, provided that complexity could be managed/handled. It is a more robust way to proceed. So, don't assume that at each step where you get some result, you have to decide on a unique one. Imagine solutions where you could ship/handle several solutions together."
