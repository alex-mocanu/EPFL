    "This part was produced using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org).  \n",
    "If you are used to it, you can [download the corresponding notebook code from here](TP1-PoSTagging.ipynb). If not, no problem at all, this is not mandatory at all: simply proceed as usual in your favorite Python environment.\n",

    "### Preliminary steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try NLTK with a simple example. The application here considered consist in associating \"_syntactic tags_\" (called \"_Part-of-Speech tags_\") to the words in a text; i.e. to determine the grammatical role of each word in the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications of PoS tagging are numerous. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* help for \"lemmatization\" (obtain the words’ canonical forms);\n",
    "* disambiguate words for higher level treatments (e.g. information extraction);\n",
    "* provide syntactic clues (\"roles\") for unknown words (\"guessers\"), ...\n",
    "\n",
    "PoS taggers usually reach a 95-99% performance level, depending on the language considered, the application and the granularity of the tag-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "More about Part-of-Speech tagging will be presented during the semester (Week 5). The purpose of the present exercise is simply to illustrate this NLP task and to check NLTK installation.\n",

    "**Note 1:** A parser can be used instead of a corpus-based POS-tagger to disambiguate words in context. But this demands more work on resource development (writing grammars), which is costly; and, the processing is also more costly: context-free parsing takes cubic time (w.r.t. sentence length) as opposed to PoS-tagging which takes linear time.\n",

    "This is a good illustration of the \"descriptive power\" as opposed to \"processing speed\" balance (i.e. compromize) presented in today's lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** Systematically disambiguating at each level of language (lexical, syntactic, semantic) is most of the time not necessary at all. It is often better to leave the disambiguation to a later, more informed, processing level, provided that complexity could be managed/handled. It is a more robust way to proceed. So, don't assume that at each step where you get some result, you have to decide on a unique one. Imagine solutions where you could ship/handle several solutions together."
